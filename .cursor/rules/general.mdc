## General Guidelines
	⁃ Generate code in TypeScript with ES6+ syntax.
	⁃ Format responses with clear comments explaining each step.
## File Size Constraints
	⁃ Keep all source code files under 200 lines to optimize Al context and prevent errors.
	⁃ Use modularization (e.g., split large functions into smaller files) if a file exceeds 200 lines.
	⁃ Prioritize generating code that adheres to this limit, suggesting refactoring if necessary.
## Quality Requirements
	⁃ All code must pass an ESLint rule enforcing a max-lines-per-file of 200.
	⁃ Avoid generating or suggesting changes to files larger than 200 lines without explicit user approval.
